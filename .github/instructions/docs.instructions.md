# Project documentation writing guidelines

## General Guidelines
- Write in clear, direct, and accessible technical language.
- Include code examples where applicable.

## Grammar
* Use present tense verbs (is, opens) instead of past tense (was, opened).
* Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals like "could" or "would".
* Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
* Write in second person (you) to speak directly to readers.

## Markdown Guidelines
- Use headings to organize content.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Include links to related resources.
- Use code blocks for code snippets.
